# GameEngineFoundations-Assignment1

### What Library did you use (SharpDX or OpenTK)?
The library I used is OpenTK. I first had to install OpenTK under dependencies to ensure that OpenTK can be used in my application.

### How to run the project
The line 'game.Run();' in Program.cs ensures that the program will successfully run to display a colored window, and a different colored rectangle.
I clicked the green play button to run my application. This will build my application to make sure that there are no errors, and it will display a terminal and an OpenTK Window with the colored window and colored rectangle.
